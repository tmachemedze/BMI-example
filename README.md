In this exercise, I follow the BMI examples in the Stata course.

We have the following variables:

`hhid`	 - "Household identifier"

`pid`	- "Individual identifier"

`w1_a_best_age_yrs`	- "Best age in years"

`w1_a_b2`	- "Gender"

`w1_a_n1_1`	- "Height measure one"

`w1_a_n2_1`	- "Weight measure one"
